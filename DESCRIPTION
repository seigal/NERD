Package: NERDTitle: The NERD package analyses temporal trends in antibiotic resistance data.Version: 0.0.0.9000Authors@R: person(given="Anna",family="Seigal",email="seigal@berkeley.edu",role=c("aut","cre"))Description: The package consists of the function NERD_function. It analyzes antibiotic resistance trends. For each data point, such as a patient, it requires temporal information (for example, the number of days since the start of the study) and resistance status (measured, or discretized, on scale with a small number of states). There is one user-defined Poisson parameter whose choice enables the method to be specialized to a range of antibiotic resistance scenarios. It returns a p-value indicating the significance of the trend.Depends:    R (>= 3.2.2)License: What license is it under?Encoding: UTF-8LazyData: trueRoxygenNote: 5.0.1.9000
